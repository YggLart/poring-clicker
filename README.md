# ✨ About this
- This is an `incremental game` made as a personal project for me to learn and understand JavaScript.
- Made the design using Figma and even posted the project at my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/142025411/Poring-Clicker) before actually coding it.
- Made using HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript.
- Althought it's not finished, it's in a State where you can play around a little bit and see it's main functionalities.
